For security reasons it's good to use different ones so that if one of them is compromised the other services are safe and you don't need to revoke and regenerate the keys for all your API/machines.\n\nIn this guide I will show you how to use a different SSH keys for each domain.\n\n","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-12-12","title":"How to use different SSH keys"},"timeToRead":3,"fields":{"slug":"/blog/ssh_multiple_keys_config/"}}},{"node":{"id":"ee1289c6-0c06-571d-b5ee-3a9a7fb9ab51","excerpt":"\nIn this guide I will show you how to use [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) to write a simple client (in C++) and server (in Go) for your service.\n\nFor this tutorial we will use the code available in the following Github project:Â [pasdam/grpcExample](https://github.com/pasdam/grpcExample).\n\nFor the client, in this article I'll show how to write a command line one, but in the repository there is also a GUI client written with the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io).\n\n","frontmatter":{"date":"2017-07-24","title":"Use gRPC/protobuf with C++ and Go"},"timeToRead":10,"fields":{"slug":"/blog/grpc_qt_go/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"tag":"tutorial"}}
