different stacks. When I started using &lt;a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">GatsbyJS&lt;/a> I
thought that would have been my last stack as I was initially very happy with
it: &lt;a href="https://react.dev/">React&lt;/a> is a very good and easy to use library to
develop frontends, the Gatsby community is big, and there are plenty of
resources or example about implementing common frontend features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately through the years I faced quite some challenges in maintaining the
blog, given that the amount of time I was willing to spend on it was very
limited and the (relatively) big effort required to keep the framework updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the journey that brought me to ditch GatsbyJS in favour of
&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
